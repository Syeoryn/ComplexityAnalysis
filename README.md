### Complexity Analysis Review

For extra practice on identifying and optimizing time complexity, take a look through these practice problems.

  * complexityAnalysis.js contains a number of functions, with the goal of understanding and identifying their time complexity.
  * complexityApplications.js asks you to write a few functions, while attempting to keep their algorithmic complexity as low as possible.

Note:  Yes, there are many different time complexities (just checkout the [list on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Table_of_common_time_complexities)!), but the main ones to start with are constant, logarithmic, linear, polynomial, and exponential.
